### Network Infrastructure Setup Demonstration

In this educational video, I demonstrate the configuration of a fictional network infrastructure as part of a assignment. Key elements include:

**DHCP** Configuration: Implementing dynamic IP address assignment for efficient network management. 

**Wireless Access Points**: Setting up WiFi with **WPA2** security to ensure protected wireless connectivity. 

**DNS** Setup: Configuring domain name resolution to translate human-readable names to IP addresses. 

**OSPF** Routing: Enabling dynamic routing protocols for optimized path selection between networks. 

**Cabling and Connectivity**: Establishing proper physical connections and verifying inter-device communication through tools like ping and web access.

This project highlights foundational networking skills that are integral to cybersecurity, such as implementing secure access controls, monitoring traffic, and preventing unauthorized intrusions.
