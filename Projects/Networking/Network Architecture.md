In this [educational video](https://youtu.be/GABJA48BxLY), I demonstrate the configuration of a fictional network infrastructure as part of a assignment. 

| Elements                 | Implementation                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DHCP Configuration**    | Implementing dynamic IP address assignment for efficient network management.                           |
| **Wireless Access Points**| Setting up WiFi with **WPA2** security to ensure protected wireless connectivity.                      |
| **DNS Setup**             | Configuring domain name resolution to translate human-readable names to IP addresses.                  |
| **OSPF Routing**          | Enabling dynamic routing protocols for optimized path selection between networks.                      |
| **Cabling and Connectivity** | Establishing proper physical connections and verifying inter-device communication through tools like ping and web access. |


This project highlights foundational networking skills that are integral to cybersecurity, such as implementing secure access controls, monitoring traffic, and preventing unauthorized intrusions.
